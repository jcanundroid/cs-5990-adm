# Importing some Python libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Defining the documents
doc1 = "soccer is my favorite sport"
doc2 = "I like sports and my favorite one is soccer"
doc3 = "support soccer at the olympic games"
doc4 = "I do like soccer, my favorite sport in the olympic games"

# Use the following words as terms to create your document-term matrix
# [soccer, favorite, sport, like, one, support, olympic, games]
# --> Add your Python code here

# Compare the pairwise cosine similarities and store the highest one
# Use cosine_similarity([X], [Y]) to calculate the similarities between 2 vectors only
# Use cosine_similarity([X, Y, Z]) to calculate the pairwise similarities between multiple vectors
# --> Add your Python code here


# Print the highest cosine similarity following the information below
# The most similar documents are: doc1 and doc2 with cosine similarity = x
# --> Add your Python code here
